# Online Retail Sales Analysis

## Project Overview 
The project focuses on analyzing sales data to uncover trends, customer behavior, and product performance. The aim is to analyze sales data, identify trends, and provide actionable insights for improving business performance.

## Data source 
The dataset used for the analysis contains sales transaction records from an online retail store. It includes eight key columns: InvoiceNo, StockCode, Description, Quantity, InvoiceDate, Unit Price, CustomerID, and Country. This data captures information on customer purchases, product details, transaction dates, pricing, and the geographic location of customers.

## Insights

- Customer Contributions: Understanding customer contributions can help in designing loyalty programs and enhancing customer relations.
  
## Tools Used:

- Excel for data cleaning.
- SQL for analyzing data.

## Data cleaning
Using Microsoft Excel, I cleaned my dataset by:

- Handling Missing Values
- Removing Duplicates
- Standardizing data Formats by ensuring consistency in both date and text formatting.
- Creating New Variables; added a Total Sales column by multiplying the Unit Price and Quantity, expanding the dataset from eight to nine columns.
